This file does not contain the Krampus app, and this project doesn't allow you to get Krampus/Ro-Exec for free. You'll need the .exe file from the loader.live site to use the application.
None of the files are malware, you can see it all here --> ![virustotal scan]([https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/725af0ab61716cf5632b42f3dcf06f252d6b68dd75a204434eb6bbae1f52c2d9/relations)
"but its marked as 'Trojan.Malware.300983.susgen'!!!" its a false positive, the reason is most likely because of the .exe (the UI) and the .dll (keeps the ui and app stable). and the .pdb is the debug software incase it ever crashes. (collects data on how and why it crashed.)
